Fast Data Structures ... in Go.

These data structures are attuned for performance in both memory and processing speed. When both cannot be achieved together, there will usually be a couple options.

## Installation
In your console, type `go get github.com/ConanHorus/fds`.

## Documentation
Documentation for each data structure type can be found in the `docs` directory, following the same directory structure as the source code.
